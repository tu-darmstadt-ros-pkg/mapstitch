  <description brief="mapstitch">

    A ROS Component and command line tool to align the current 2D /map or an
    image of a map to a previously saved map. The map to align to is assumed to
    be a .pgm created by the map_saver component (but other may work too). There
    are no additional sanity checks like matching resolution of the supplied
    maps.

    The estimated transform (with
    3 DOF, rotation and translation) is either published as tf between the
    /world and /map frame, returned on the command line or saved as a stitched
    image.
